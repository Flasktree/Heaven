# Heaven
A program I made back in highschool. Displays a spirograph being drawn in real time. Tends to keep going until crashing, I should revisit this concept at some point.
Upon run, a cmd window and turtle window should appear. The cmd should give a message, and the turtle should begin immediately after.
